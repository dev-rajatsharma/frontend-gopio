                        GOPIO, International was founded in New York in 1989. In June, 2010 GOPIO has commenced a chapter in Virginia under the leadership of Mr.Jay Singh Bhandari.
                        GOPIO Virginia was inagrurated on a cruise in the water's of the Potomac River. It was a full moon night and members enjoyed a 3 hour ride on a boat with a concert from Munni Begam, well-known Gazal singer. The very first year our membership grew to 65 members.

                        The initial thrust of GOPIO was fighting human rights violation of people of Indian origin. Although this has been improved in the last one decade, human rights violations continue to be a major issue for PIOs living outside India. GOPIO has now set its priorities in pooling our resources, both financial and professional, for the benefit of PIOs, the countries they come from and India.
